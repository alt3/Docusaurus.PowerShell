This project was created to help you document and showcase your Powershell Modules.

Instead of reinventing the wheel and failing in an area where Powershell does not excel
(frontend development), this project provides a bridge between your
[Powershell Comment-Based Help](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comment_based_help?view=powershell-6)
and [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a static website generator written
in React, with an empahasis on ease-of-use.

This cross-technology approach allows you to focus on documenting your modules without having
to worry about frontend development and maintenance, all handled by the Docusaurus community.

Some of the features you will get:

- a website for promoting your module
- auto-generated Get-Help documentation
- support for complex multi-line Get-Help code examples
- authoring pages in both Markdown and Powershell source files
- localization, versioning and fully indexed (Algolia) search
- simplified publishing (Netlify, Github Pages)
- dark mode

## :fire: Vendor Agnostic

This module can produce vendor agnostic output for users who
**do not want to use Docusaurus** but still want to benefit
of advanced features like Get-Help Code Fence Detection.

## Early Bird

Just like Docusaurus v2, this module is still in it's early stages.
Features are deliberately kept to a minimum so we can make
things work first, then make it better.

## Feedback

Suggestions, bug reports, fixes and :star::star::star: welcomed at our
[Github repository](https://github.com/alt3/Docusaurus.Powershell).
