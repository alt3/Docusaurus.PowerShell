Docusaurus supports fully indexed search by hooking into the Algolia DocSearch service.

However, by default, the Docusaurus searchbar will not be available for your website
**until you configure it**.

To enable search:

1. [Apply for the Algolia DocSearch service](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/)
2. [Update your Docusaurus configuration file](https://docusaurus.io/docs/search/#connecting-algolia)
